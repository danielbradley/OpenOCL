22 Jun 2005:	libopenocl_ui-1.0.8

		VisualDisplay has been merged with Visual. Lots of other changes.

02 Mar 2005:	libopenocl_ui-0.7.2

		This is the last version that called a VisualDisplay interface
		an AbstractDisplay. I just can't come up with a better name than
		VisualDisplay apart from Display, however that conflicts with
		X11's Display type.

02 Dec 2004:	libopenocl_ui-0.7.1
19 Nov 2004:	initial import of version 0.7
